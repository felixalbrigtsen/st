  - `git apply felixalbConf.diff`
- "Install" from below:
  - `sudo make clean install`


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:
